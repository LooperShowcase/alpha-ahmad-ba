        Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American
        electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto,
        California, United States. The company announced plans to move its
        headquarters to Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric
        cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and
        solar roof tiles, and related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had
        the most sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric
        vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in
        hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market.
        Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major
        installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is
        also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage
        systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2020. Founded in July
        2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the
        company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola
        Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment, X.com
        co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and
        its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the
        purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport
        and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla
        began production of its first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was
        followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in
        2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover
        in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric
        car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell
        1 million units globally.[7] Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550
        units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year. In October 2021,
        Tesla's market capitalization reached US$1 trillion, the sixth company
        to do so in U.S. history. Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits
        and controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and
        from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation,
        worker rights violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical
        problems with their products. In September 2021, the National Highway
        Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data
        pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with Autopilot.
